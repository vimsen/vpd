The Virtual Prosumersâ€™ (VP) Dashboard (VPD) is the Graphical User Interface of the VPs and of their Virtual Gateways, 
and also the control panel of VP-related activities. 

Since, VPD is a client-side application, it does not have specific requirements in order to be installed. It just needs 
a web server, where the VPD files (html, css, js) will be located. 

For testing purposes one can use live-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), which is a lightweight development 
server with live reload capabilities.
